# Atone's Labyrinth

## Description
Random maze generation using depth first search with backtracking. Mazes are infinitely stitched together creating the mythical inescapable Labyrinth. You are a prisoner in this maze and must avoid the minotaur while seeking the exit. Avoid traps and collect artifacts along the way to protect yourself and defeat the dreadbull. Only when the monster is slain can freedom be found.

Some credit is due to Daniel Schiffman of The Coding Train youtube channel, whose videos on maze generation served as a jumping-off point for this game. He produces entertaining, educational content and I highly recommend his channel to beginner and intermediate programmers alike.

This project began as a 1:1 love port of the maze generator made in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4
We are using the maze generation algorithm described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker
