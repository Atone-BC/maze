# Atone's Labyrinth

## Description
Randomly generated mazes are infinitely stitched together to create the inescapable Labyrinth of myth and legend. You are a prisoner in this maze and must avoid the minotaur while seeking the exit. Dodge traps and collect artifacts along the way to defend yourself and defeat the dreadbull. Only when the monster is slain may freedom be found.

## Items
There are several objects in the game world that can be walked over to gain some effect.
**Athena's Sheild** - Absorbs one hit from a trap or the minotaur. Stuns the minotaur on block.
**Ariadne's Sword** - Allows the player to slay the stunned minotaur.
**Daedalus' Wings** - Allows temporary flight over walls.
**Helm of Hades** - Grants temporary invisibility and ability to pass through minotaur.
**Hermes' Sandals** - Gives immunity to traps and possibly makes movement go to collision with wall instead of next tile.
**Trap** - Stuns anyone who walks over it.
**Ariadne's Thread** - Dropped by the slain minotaur, reveals path to exit.

## Credits
Some credit is due to Daniel Schiffman of The Coding Train YouTube channel, whose videos on maze generation served as a jumping-off point for this game. He produces entertaining, educational content and I highly recommend his channel to aspiring programmers. This project began as a 1:1 love port of the maze generator made in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4

The maze generation algorithm used is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker

Made using the wonderful LÃ–VE framework. https://love2d.org/

## Build Instructions
* Download love.
* Download this project.
* Locate the project folder containing main.lua
* Run it by dragging the folder onto the love icon or from terminal with `love ~/pathto/folder`

When it's more feature complete, I'll release executables.
