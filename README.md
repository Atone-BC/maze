# Atone's Labyrinth

## Description
Random maze generation using depth first search. Mazes are infinitely stitched together creating the mythical inescapable Labyrinth. You are a prisoner in this maze and must avoid the minotaur while seeking the exit. Avoid traps and collect artifacts along the way to protect yourself and defeat the dreadbull. Only when the monster is slain can freedom be found.

##Credits
Some credit is due to Daniel Schiffman of The Coding Train youtube channel, whose videos on maze generation served as a jumping-off point for this game. He produces entertaining, educational content and I highly recommend his channel to aspiring programmers. This project began as a 1:1 love port of the maze generator made in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4

Made using the wonderful LÃ–VE framework. https://love2d.org/

The maze generation algorithm used is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker

##Build Instructions
* Download love.
* Download this project.
* Locate the project folder containing main.lua
* Run it by dragging the folder onto the love icon or from terminal with `love ~/pathto/folder`

When it's more feature complete, I'll release executables.
